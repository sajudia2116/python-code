 print("it is divisiable by 10")
 else:
 print("not it is not divisiable by 10")
 not it is not divisiable by 10


 5.) Accept age of a person. If age is less than 18, print minor otherwise Major.
 age = int(input("Enter the age of person:"))
 if(age<18):
 print("minor")
 else:
 print("major")
 Enter the age of person:19
 major


 6.) Accept a number from the user. And print number of digits in it.
 number = input("Enter the numbers:")
 print(len(number))
 Enter the numbers:999
 3


 7.) Accept a year value from the user. Check whether it is a leap year or not.
 year = int(input("Enter the year:"))
 if( year % 4 == 0 and ( year % 400 == 0 or year % 100 != 0 )):
 print("it is a leap year")
 else:
 print("it is not leap year")
 Enter the year:2007
 it is not leap year


 8.) Check whether a triangle is valid or not, when the three angles of the triangle are entered through the keyboard. A triangle is valid if te sum
 of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees.
 side1 = int(input("Enter the 1st side:"))
 side2 = int(input("Enter the 2nd side:"))
 side3 = int(input("Enter the 3rd side:"))
 if(side1 + side2 +side3 == 180):
 print("triange is valid")
 else:
 print("triange is invalid")
 Enter the 1st side:80
 Enter the 2nd side:50
 Enter the 3rd side:50
 triange is valid


 9.) Print absolute value of a given number.
 num = -9090
 print(abs(num))
 9090


 10.) Given the length and breadth of a rectangle, write a program to find whether theare of the rectangle is greater than its perimeter.
 length = 890
 breath = 89
 area = length * breath
 perimeter = 2*(length + breath)
 if(area > perimeter):
 print('area is greater than perimeter')
 else:
 print('area is smaller than perimeter')
 area is greater than perimeter


 11.) Given three points (x1,y1), (x2,y2) and (x3,y3), check if all the three points fall on one straight line
 x1 = 99
 x2 = 70
 x3 =96
 y1 =35
 y2 = 44
 y3 =72
 a = (x1*(y2-y3))+(x2*(y3-y1))+(x3*(y1-y2))
 if (a == 0):
 print('all the points fall on one stright line') else:
 print("all the points dont fall on one stright line")
 all the points dont fall on one stright line


 12.) Given the coordinates (x,y) of center of a circle and its radius, determine whether a point lies inside the circle, on the circle or outside the
 circle. (Hint: Use sqrt( ), pow( ) )
 import math
 circle_m = 99
 circle_n = 198
 radius = 99
 point_m = 99
 point_n = 99
 distance = math.sqrt(math.pow(point_m - circle_m, 2) +
 math.pow(point_n - circle_n, 2))
 if distance < radius:
 print(f"The point ({point_m}, {point_n}) is inside the circle.")
 elif distance == radius:
 print(f"The point ({point_m}, {point_n}) is on the circle.")
 else:
 print(f"The point ({point_m}, {point_n}) is outside the circle.")
 The point (99, 99) is on the circle.


 13.) Convert number 0 to 19 to its equivalent words. E.g. 0  zero, 19 nineteen.
 numbers = 19
 numbers_word = [
 "zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven",
 "eight", "nine",
 "ten", "eleven", "twelve", "thirteen", "fourteen", "fifteen",
 "sixteen",
 "seventeen", "eighteen", "nineteen"
 ]
 if 0 <= numbers <= 19:
 print(f"The number {numbers} is written as'{numbers_word[numbers]}'.")
 else:
 print("Number is out of range (0-19).")
 The number 19 is written as'nineteen'.


 14.) Accept marks of three subjects. Print total and average along with whether a candidate has passed or fail. If student secures <= 39
 marks in any subject, consider him as fail. Also assigned a subject wise grade based on the following table: bold text
 sub1 = int(input("Enter the maths marks:"))
 sub2 = int(input("Enter the chemistry marks:"))
 sub3 = int(input("Enter the physics marks:"))
 sum = ( sub1 + sub2 + sub3 ) / 3
 if(sub1 <= 39 or sub2 <=39 or sub3<=39):
 print("Fail")
 elif(sum>= 40 and sum <=44 ):
 print("P")
 elif(sum>= 45 and sum <=49 ):
 print("C")
 elif(sum>= 50 and sum <=54 ):
 print("B")
 elif(sum>= 55 and sum <=59 ):
 print("B+")
 elif(sum>= 60 and sum <= 69 ):
 print("A")
 elif(sum>= 70 and sum <= 79):
 print("A+")
 elif(sum>= 80 and sum <=100 ):
 print("O")
 else:
 print("good")
 Enter the maths marks:87
 Enter the chemistry marks:78
 Enter the physics marks:99
 O
